Default child theme for [Cherry Framework 4](https://github.com/CherryFramework/cherryframework4)

If you are using framework for building your Wordpress theme we highly recommend creating a child theme. Using child theme prevents your files changes from removal when updating framework files to future releases. Child theme fully inherits functionality of the parent theme so you need to copy the files. 

You can learn more about Wordpress child theme principles from the [official Wordpress documentation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)
